# Sparse Neural Network Experiment (MNIST)

This mini-project explores sparse neural networks, inspired by the brain and Google’s Pathways architecture.

🧠 **What it does**:
- Builds a simple neural network for MNIST
- Starts with **sparse connections**
- Learns which connections to keep or drop
- Visualizes the sparse connection matrix

🔬 This is a proof-of-concept inspired by PathNet and biologically plausible learning!
